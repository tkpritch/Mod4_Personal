Description: This assignment uses real-world marine data collected as part of Queensland fisheries QFISH database to develop a report.

#____________________________________________________________________________

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
	echo = TRUE,
	message = FALSE,
	warning = FALSE
)
```

load required packages
```{r}
library(DataViz)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggthemes)
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
```


### Part 1: Obtain data

[Shark Control Program](https://qfish.fisheries.qld.gov.au/query/number-caught-by-area-calendar-year-and-species-group/table)

Data was first downloaded from the above link. However, after viewing the data in excel, I went back to the above link and customized how the data was sorted so there were less NA values and blank cells. It was exported as Comma Separated Values (CSV) and saved in Github repo [Mod4_Personal](https://github.com/tkpritch/Mod4_Personal.git)


### Part 2: Tidy data

Import dataset
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
shark <- read_csv("../data/sharkdatacustom.csv")
```


Delete rows with NA as they are just the rows that have the total numbers in them
```{r}
shark <- na.omit(shark)
```

Change column name so there are no spaces
```{r}
shark <- shark %>% rename(`Count` = `NumberCaught Total`)
```


Create a bar plot showing catch data of the 4 groups over all the years
```{r}
ggplot(data = shark) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = SpeciesGroup, y = Count), stat = "identity")
```

Create a bar plot showing 
```{r}
ggplot(data = shark) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = SpeciesGroup, y = Count, fill = Area), stat = "identity")
```

Create a bar plot showing only the shark catch over the years 
```{r}
shark_filtered <- shark %>%
  filter(SpeciesGroup == "Shark")

shark_filtered <- shark_filtered %>%
  mutate(CalendarYear = as.numeric(CalendarYear))
         
ggplot(data = shark_filtered) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = CalendarYear, y = Count), stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Catch Data for Sharks",
       x = "Area",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
fishmeth <- read_csv("C:/Users/Admin/Downloads/export.csv")

filtered_fishmeth <- fishmeth %>%
  filter(!grepl("Total", CalendarYear)) %>%
  filter(CalendarYear != "2024 incomplete") %>%
  mutate_all(~ ifelse(. == "N/A", NA, .)) %>%
  mutate_all(~ ifelse(is.na(.), 0, .))

filtered_fishmeth$Tonnes <- as.numeric(gsub("[,.]", "", filtered_fishmeth$Tonnes))

filtered_fishmeth <- filtered_fishmeth %>%
  mutate(Tonnes = as.numeric(Tonnes),
         CalendarYear = as.numeric(CalendarYear))

ggplot(data = filtered_fishmeth) +
  geom_line(aes(x = CalendarYear, y = Tonnes, colour = FishingMethod))

```
