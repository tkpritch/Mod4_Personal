### Part 1: Obtain data

[Shark Control Program](https://qfish.fisheries.qld.gov.au/query/number-caught-by-area-calendar-year-and-species-group/table)

Data was first downloaded from the above link. However, after viewing the data in excel, I went back to the above link and customized how the data was sorted so there were less NA values and blank cells. It was exported as Comma Separated Values (CSV) and saved in Github repo [Mod4_Personal](https://github.com/tkpritch/Mod4_Personal.git)


### Part 2: Tidy data

Import dataset
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
shark <- read_csv("../data/sharkdatacustom.csv")
```


Delete rows with NA
```{r}
shark <- na.omit(shark)
```


### Part 3: Plot
