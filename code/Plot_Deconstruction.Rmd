Description: This assignment was done in pairs and focuses on graphical storytelling in R and trying to fix up a plot to better convey the message the data is getting across. 

#____________________________________________________________________________

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
	echo = TRUE,
	message = FALSE,
	warning = FALSE
)
```

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
```


## Part 1: Choose data

Data was obtained from Our World in Data website: [Number of described species](https://ourworldindata.org/how-many-species-are-there)

Data for the plot is available from the above link, first clicking the link below the figure that says `Learn more about this data` and then clinking the link in the bullet point: The source for each taxonomic group can be found in the [IUCN Red List summary statistics, Table 1a.](https://nc.iucnredlist.org/redlist/content/attachment_files/2023-1_RL_Table_1a.pdf)`. The PDF that automatically downloads was the data that was organized in Excel before being wrangled in Part 3.



## Part 2: Deconstruct the plot

```{r}
#| fig.cap = "Figure 1. Screenshot of the original Our World In Data `Number of described species` plot. Data collected from Our World in Data website."
knitr::include_graphics("../data/spporgplot.PNG")
```




This plot can be improved first, by taking away the "all groups" categories and second, putting the data on a log scale both to reduce the skew of the plot. 

When first on the Our World in Data page, the groups selected didn't seem to have any reason or rhyme, so another way that this plot could be improved is by digging deeper into the data and splitting the groups into more specific or higher classified groups for compartmentalization.



## Part 3: Reconstruct a better version of the plot

Import dataset from Github that has all the groups and their counts
```{r}
sppgrouplist <- read_csv("../data/sppgrouplist.csv")
```

First way plot can be improved:
Create a plot that shows the overall count of groups on a log scale.
```{r}
#| fig.cap = "Figure 2. Total number of described species as of 2022 in each taxonomic group transformed on a log scale, ordered by richness. Data obtained from Our World in Data website."
ggplot(sppgrouplist, aes(x = count, y = reorder(main, count))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", show.legend = FALSE, fill = "royalblue4") +
  geom_text(aes(label = count), hjust = 1.1, color = "white") + #Adjust text position
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log10", breaks = c(1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 0.5),
        plot.title.position = "plot", #Center title
        plot.margin = margin(20, 20, 20, 20, "pt")) + #Adjust margins
  labs(x = "Count", y = "Group") +
  theme_minimal()
```



Second way plot can be improved:
Create a plot that has the groups put into groups as a facet bar plot.
```{r}
#| fig.cap = "Figure 3. Total number of described species as of 2022 grouped within four main taxonomic groups: Fungi/Protists, Invertebrates, Plants and Vertebrates. Data obtained from Our World in Data website."
ggplot(sppgrouplist, aes(x = count, y = main, fill = group)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_text(aes(label = count), nudge_x = -0.5, size = 3.2) +  
  facet_wrap(~ group, scales = "free_y", ncol = 2, nrow = 2) +  
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Pastel1") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(x = "Count ", y = "Group") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold"),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 10)
  )
```
