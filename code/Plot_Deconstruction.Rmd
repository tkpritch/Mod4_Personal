Description: This assignment uses real-world marine data collected as part of Queensland fisheries QFISH database to develop a report.

## Part 1: Choose data

Data was obtained from Our World in Data website: [Number of described species](https://ourworldindata.org/how-many-species-are-there)

Data for the plot is available from the above link, first clicking the link below the figure that says `Learn more about this data` and then clinking the link in the bullet point: The source for each taxonomic group can be found in the 'IUCN Red List summary statistics, Table 1a.`. The PDF that automatically downloads was the data that was wrangled for Part 3. 


## Part 2: Deconstruct the plot

```{r}
#| fig.cap = "Figure 1. Screenshot of the original Our World In Data `Number of described species` plot. Data collected from Our World in Data website."
knitr::include_graphics("../data/spporgplot.PNG")
```


This plot can be improved first, by taking away the "all groups" categories and second, putting the data on a log scale both to reduce the skew of the plot. 

When first on the Our World in Data page, the groups selected didn't seem to have any reason or rhyme, so another way that this plot could be improved is by digging deeper into the data and splitting the groups into more specific or higher classified groups for compartmentalization.


## Part 3: Reconstruct a better version of the plot

First way plot can be improved:
Import dataset from Github that has all the groups and their counts
```{r}
groupcount <- read_csv("../data/sppcount.csv")
```

Remove the data for "all groups"
```{r}
#List methods to be excluded
exclude <- c("All groups")

#Filter out methods
groupcount_noall <- groupcount %>%
  filter(!group %in% exclude)
```

Create a plot that shows the overall count of groups on a log scale.
```{r}
#| fig.cap = "Figure 2. Total number of described species as of 2022 in each taxonomic group transformed on a log scale. Data obtained from Our World in Data website."
ggplot(groupcount_noall, aes(x = sppcount, y = reorder(group, sppcount))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", show.legend = FALSE, fill = "royalblue4") +
  geom_text(aes(label = sppcount), hjust = 1.1, color = "white") + #Adjust text position
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log10", breaks = c(1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 0.5),
        plot.title.position = "plot", #Center title
        plot.margin = margin(20, 20, 20, 20, "pt")) + #Adjust margins
  labs(x = "Count", y = "Group") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Second way plot can be improved:
Import dataset from Github that has the groups sorted into a smaller number of groups
```{r}
sppgrouplist <- read_csv("../data/sppgrouplist.csv")
```

Create a plot that has the groups put into groups as a facet bar plot.
```{r}
#| fig.cap = "Figure 3. Total number of described species as of 2022 grouped within four main taxonomic groups: Fungi/Protists, Invertebrates, Plants and Vertebrates. Data obtained from Our World in Data website."
ggplot(sppgrouplist, aes(x = count, y = main, fill = group)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_text(aes(label = count), nudge_x = -0.5, size = 3.2) +  
  facet_wrap(~ group, scales = "free_y", ncol = 2, nrow = 2) +  
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Pastel1") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(x = "Count ", y = "Group") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold"),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 10)
  )
```
